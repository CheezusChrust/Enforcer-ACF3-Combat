Enforcer extension for ACF-3 combat. Detours Expression 2, Starfall and Wiremod gate functionality to achieve its goals.

Currently has the following features (todo: add disabling extensions to Enforcer base!)
- Applyforce Visualization, to help players detect mobility assistance
- Block Entity:Use() Automation, blocks e:use() and wire users from doing anything.
