Enforcer extension for ACF-3 combat. Detours Expression 2, Starfall and Wiremod gate functionality to achieve its goals.

Currently has the following features (todo: add disabling extensions to Enforcer base!)
- Applyforce Visualization, to help players detect mobility assistance
- Restrict Entity:Use() Automation, restricts e:use() (E2 and SF) and wire users from doing anything unless within 250 source units of the entity.
